----------------Change directory using an absolute path
                To change the directory by using an absolute path, we have to mention the whole path starting from the root
                From the above output, we are changing our directory to 'certs' from 'cups.' So,
                we have provided the whole path "/run/cups/certs" starting from the root (/). This is called an absolute path.
                command ::
                 /* /illin4606!choudhar:~ [263]$ cd IpBlockingissue
                 illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue [264]$ pwd
                 /attuser/ats/users/choudhar/IpBlockingissue
                 illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue [265]$ ls
                 com  Directory  final_ip_code  META-INF  Schedule  Search  TCDIL.jar  XSSBlockingFilter.class
                 illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue [266]$ cd /attuser/ats/users/choudhar/IpBlockingissue */



-----------------Change directory using a relative path
                 We can change our directory by using a relative path; a relative path is a location that is relative to
                 the current directory.

                  command : :
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/com [286]$ cd ..
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue [287]$ cd /com/sbcdo/TCDIL/servlet/
                  /com/sbcdo/TCDIL/servlet/: No such file or directory.
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue [288]$ cd com/sbcdo/TCDIL/servlet/
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/com/sbcdo/TCDIL/servlet [289]$
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/com/sbcdo/TCDIL/servlet [289]$


---------------- Change to the home directory :
                   command : cd ~ / cd
---------------- Change to the previous directory
                ` To change to the previous directory from the current working directory, execute the command as follows
                  command : cd -

---------------- : change to the root directory
                   To navigate directory to entire system's root directory from current working directory, execute the command as follows:
                   command : cd /

---------------- Change to another user's home directory
                   We can change the directory from the current working directory to a user's home directory by executing the command as follows:
                 command : ~username like cd ~mb_ccats

---------------- Change to Directory having Spaces
                 To change the directory that has spaces in its name, surround the path with quotes (' ') or use the backslash (\) character with it. Execute the command as follows:
                 command  : cd 'this is multiple word dir'
