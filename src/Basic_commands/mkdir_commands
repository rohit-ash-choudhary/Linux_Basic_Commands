                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/Schedule [175]$ mkdir -p a/aaa
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/Schedule [176]$ ls
                  a  b  c  l  x  xxx  y  z
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/Schedule [177]$ cd a
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/Schedule/a [178]$ ls
                  aaa
                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/Schedule/a [179]$

mkdir -v : mkdir -v' command will print a message with every new file created.
          illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/Schedule [170]$ mkdir -v x y z
          command :
                  mkdir: created directory `x'
                  mkdir: created directory `y'
                  mkdir: created directory `z'
mkdir -pv : Both the commands 'mkdir -pv' and 'mkdir -vp' are same. By combining -p you can create a long list files together like
           "office/client/raj/date/day"with a printed message for each file.
           commands :
                      illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue/Schedule [172]$ mkdir -pv l/m/n/p/o
                      mkdir: created directory `l'
                      mkdir: created directory `l/m'
                      mkdir: created directory `l/m/n'
                      mkdir: created directory `l/m/n/p'
                      mkdir: created directory `l/m/n/p/o'
mkdir -m : With the help of this command, you can access the permission on the directory you are creating. Access means to give the authority to read(r), write(w), and execute(x).
            You can access the permission in different ways to your directory.
            commands :
                    "mkdir -m=rwx <file>"
                     or
                    "mkdir -m 777 <file>".
