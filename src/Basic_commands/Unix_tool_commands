Find           :
                The find command helps us to find a particular file within a directory.
                It is used to find the list of files for the various conditions like permission,
                user ownership, modification, date/time, size, and more.
                The find utility comes by default with most of the Linux distros,
                so we don't need to install any additional package. It is one of the most essential and used commands of the Linux system.

                find <location> <comparison-criteria> <search-term>
                The following symbols are used to specify the directory:
                (.) : For current directory name
                (/) : For the root directory

      ----- Find File by name :
                    Syntax : find . -iname <filename>
                    illin4606!choudhar:~ [272]$ find . -iname a.txt
                    ./IpBlockingissue/Schedule/a.txt
                    ls./a.txt
      ----- Finding files by type
                    The '-type' parameter is used to specify the file type.

                    Some of the file types are as follows:

                    f: regular file
                    d: directory
                    l: symbolic links
                    c: character devices
                    b: block devices

                   -- File by type
                   Syn : find . -type d -name "*.bak"
                   he above command will list all the directories having '.bak' extension.
                               illin4606!choudhar:~ [282]$ find . -iname '*.txt'
                               ./IpBlockingissue/aaa.txt
                               ./IpBlockingissue/Schedule/a.txt
                               ./IpBlockingissue/Schedule/b.txt
                               ./IpBlockingissue/b.txt
                               ./temp/mvcjar/xmldetails/XmlDetailsHelper.txt

      Find newer files:  '-newer' parameter helps in searching the files which are newer than the
                          mentioned file. Consider the below command:
                          will display all the files which are newer than ' msg.txt' from the current working directory.
                          find . -newer msg.txt : all the files displayed are newer than the 'msg.txt' file.

                          Syn :
                                  illin4606!choudhar:~/IpBlockingissue [287]$ find . -newer  XSSBlockingFilter.class
                                  .
                                  ./TCDIL.jar
                                  ./OTPAuth.class
                                  ./aaa.txt
                                  ./Schedule
                                  ./Schedule/a.txt
                                  ./Schedule/XSSBlockingFilter.class
                                  ./Schedule/b.txt
                                  ./Directory
                                  ./com/sbcdo/TCDIL/servlet
                                  ./com/sbcdo/TCDIL/servlet/XSSBlockingFilter.class
                                  ./log
                                  ./b.txt

      ----------- The '-delete' option is used to delete a specific file. We need to be very careful while using this command because there is no undo option if it is once executed. Consider the below command:

                    find . -name Demo.txt -delete


      Find A Directory : The ' type -d' option is used to find a directory. Consider the below command:
                          find . type -depth -name Newdirectory

                          illin4606!choudhar:~ [291]$ find . type -depth -name Search
                          ./copy/Search
                          find: `type': No such file or directory
                          illin4606!choudhar:~ [292]$
